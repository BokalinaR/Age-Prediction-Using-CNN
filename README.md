## About the project
The main goal of the project is to classify images by age based on faces
UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of 23,705 face images, size 200x200, with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images are sorted by age and and only faces are seen. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regressionetc.
Image should be classified in one of the classes. Each class representes the range of ages. The CNN architectures used are: vgg16, resNet, and one model that we made. Our model has seven classes, and there are two files with different hyperparameters, Vgg16 and resNet are used with transfer learning.
